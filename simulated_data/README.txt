This folder contains the data related to the simulated crinoids datasets.

It contains the following folders:
- datasets contains .RData files with the simulated trees, sequences and fossil occurrences for all simulation conditions (highfs and lowfs correspond to high and low fossil sampling settings, respectively)
- results contains summaries of the results on the simulated datasets. "mean_norm_dist" files contain the RF distances for all runs, and "analysis" files all the other measures. Runs that did not converge are indicated by NA values.
- sources contains the files used to calibrate the simulation, i.e. the PBDB readout used to simulate realistic fossil age ranges and the log file used to calibrate the clock rate
